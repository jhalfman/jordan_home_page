                    I am currently working as a Molecular Technologist II at Exact Sciences.  My role is to extract DNA from a patient's tumor sample and transform it into a DNA sequence.  This
                    data is analyzed by a pathologist and used to individually treat each patient. I hope to transition into our software development department after completing my Flatiron
                    program.

            <p>
                In my spare time, my favorite thing to do is play video games. I used to play games on a variety of consoles, but now I mostly spend time on my PC or the Nintendo Switch. I also
                enjoy television and movies, cooking, taking care of my cats, and hanging out with my boyfriend, Felix. If I'm not hanging out at a friend's house, then you will most likely find me
                hanging out in my room.

        <p>Tango has been living with me since 2014.  I got her when she was only a 5 months old and now she is almost eight!  We go outside everyday because she likes to chew on grass and hunt for lizards.  Sometimes she tries to get on the roof, but then she gets in trouble</p>

        <p>Texas Donut is only 10 months old, but he already weighs 13 pounds! His adoption name was "Ox" because he was the largest kitten in the litter, and that's why we chose him.  He's a true sweet heart and enjoys a good cuddle, but he still causes a kitten-amount of terror and destruction around the house</p>
