                    I am currently working as a Molecular Technologist II at Exact Sciences.  My role is to extract DNA from a patient's tumor sample and transform it into a DNA sequence.  This
                    data is analyzed by a pathologist and used to individually treat each patient. I hope to transition into our software development department after completing my Flatiron
                    program. To learn about genome sequencing, visit the wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing" target="_blank">here,</a> or learn about

                In my spare time, my favorite thing to do is play video games. I used to play games on a variety of consoles, but now I mostly spend time on my PC or the Nintendo Switch. I also
                enjoy television and movies, cooking, taking care of my cats, and hanging out with my boyfriend, Felix. If I'm not hanging out at a friend's house, then you will most likely find me
                hanging out in my room.

                    <p>I've had Tango since 2014, and she'll be turning 8 years old in April! She loves to chew on grass and chase lizards outside, and she's always got something to say.
                        She's not extremely cuddly, but she loves to lie down JUST outside your reach. Go ahead and scratch her head or rub her belly--but not for too long!</p>

                    <p>We got Texas in the summer of 2021, so he is still less than a year old, but he weighs in at a whopping 13 pounds! His adoption name was 'Ox,' because he was the biggest in the litter.
                        Texas is a big snuggler, and he will wake you up multiple times in the middle of the night just to make some biscuits on your face. He eats enough for both cats, and we're not sure if
                        he's actually done growing.</p>

        <p>Tango has been living with me since 2014.  I got her when she was only a 5 months old and now she is almost eight!  We go outside everyday because she likes to chew on grass and hunt for lizards.  Sometimes she tries to get on the roof, but then she gets in trouble</p>

        <p>Texas Donut is only 10 months old, but he already weighs 13 pounds! His adoption name was "Ox" because he was the largest kitten in the litter, and that's why we chose him.  He's a true sweet heart and enjoys a good cuddle, but he still causes a kitten-amount of terror and destruction around the house</p>
